This Restaurant Management System was created using Visual Basic, alongside the IBM DB2 system to simulate a Point-of-Sale System for a <i>carinderia.</i>
Critical functions include:
  * CRUD operations on customer data, employee data, and supplier data.
  * Inventory Management System on the store's ingredients and food sales.
  * Item Delivery/Release Systems on the store's current inventory.
  * Simple Analytics on store sales (total and individual sales); has the option to view sales for a particular date.

This project has a documentation containing a **Business Scenario**, **Scope and Limitations**, **Business Rules**, **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**, **Sample Data**,
**Data Dictionary**, and **Actual Table Definitions/Descriptions**.
